# PUSHBOARD

[Pushboard](http://www.pushboardportland.com) is weekly newsletter of curated events in Portland, OR. This Rails app lets users subscribe to the mailing list and submit events to be included in future newsletters.

Currently, form submissions just send an email to the newsletter coordinator using [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/). In the future, the site should allow admins to manage subscribers and submitted events, build newsletters, and send them from the app.

## To do:
* Update and delete subscribers
* Update and delete events
* Build newsletters from submitted events
* Send newsletters to specific subscribers
